##Resume ###This is an work made to improve my skills on JAVA using basically JAVA, Netbeans and MySQL.

##Concept ###As a web developer I tried to apply some concepts in this project like abstract classes, inheritance, funcions, string, characters and regular expressions, arrays, GUI components (jPanel, jComboBox) and generic collections of lists, stacks and queues.

##Layout ###The layout It's very simple and functional, I've tried to focus more in the integrations between pages and the database arrangement too, so as a simple input/consult system aplication we can handle a bunch of functions.
